## AutoMachineTool

### Usage
- Research on automatic machine tool.
- Place the AutoMachineTool facing the work table.
- Set the output destination of the finished product.
- The AutomaticMachineTool executes a request that can be worked with materials in eight directions around the work table in the work request.

### Function
- You can specify the output destination. If the output destination is in the stockpiling zone and the finished product can be placed, it is placed somewhere in the stockpiling zone containing the output destination.
- Even if the output destination is in the stockpiling zone, the finished product can not be placed, but it is placed in the cell specified as the output destination.
- You can select the automatic machine tool and change the power supply amount from the power tab. If the power supply amount is large, the creation speed increases.
- As the tier goes up, you can create an AutoMachineTool with a high skill level.
- You can set the upper and lower limits of power supply amount, skill level and speed factors for each tier on the Mod setting screen.

### Caution
- If there is no place to place after completion, processing stops waiting for placement. You can prevent finished goods by moving them on a belt conveyor or the like, or by setting the output destination to a stockpiling zone.
- If you destroy a work table or automatic machine tool during work, material may be lost.
- I think balance is not good.

### TODO
- Balancing.

## BeltConveyor

### Usage
- Research on belt conveyor.
- Place it in the direction you want to carry.
- Place the item on top. (Item Puller and AutoMachineTool can be used.)
- The belt conveyors are connected by vertically adjoining the orientation.

### Function
- If belt conveyors are connected and there are two or more output destinations, it is possible to set the filter for each output destination from the filter tab.
- If the output destination can be placed in the stockpiling zone, the output destination is placed somewhere in the stockpiling zone that contains the output destination.
- Even if the destination can not be placed in the stockpiling zone, it will be placed in the cell specified as the output destination.
- There is a belt conveyor that can be placed in the wall.

### Caution
- If there is no place to place it, the item is blocked.
- Colonists are not involved with items on the belt conveyor.
- I think balance is not good.

### TODO

## Item Puller

### Usage
- Research on belt conveyor.
- Place it next to the pulling zone. Pull out from the opposite side of the installed orientation and output it in the installed orientation.
- Since the drawing machine is in a non-operating state in the post-installation state, it selects the drawing machine and put it in the operating state from the button.

### Function
- You can specify filters for items to be pulled from the filter tab.
- If the output destination can be placed in the stockpiling zone, the output destination is placed somewhere in the stockpiling zone that contains the output destination.
- Even if the destination can not be placed in the stockpiling zone, it will be placed in the cell specified as the output destination.
- There is a Puller that can be placed in the wall.


### Caution
- If the output destination is a belt conveyor and the item already exists, the item will be placed in placement.
- If the output destination is not a belt conveyor and the item already exists, it will be placed near the output destination.
- I think balance is not good.
