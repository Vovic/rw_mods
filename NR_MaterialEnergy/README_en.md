## Material Converter

![material converter](/NR_MaterialEnergy/About/image01.png)

### Usage
- Research on material energy.
- install a material converter.
- Select the scan from the Processing tab and enable the filter for the items you want to scan.
- A recipe to convert scanned items from energy to matter is created.
- Select Energize material from the Processing tab and enable the filter for items to be energized.
- Since energy is generated when it is processed, it saves the amount of energy to convert from energy to matter.
- Select materialization scanned and registered from the Processing tab.
- Energy is used and materialized.

### Function
- The scan creates an energy-to-material conversion recipe.
- Energy conversion from substances is possible in units of 10 and 100.
- Material conversion from energy is possible in units of 1, 10 units.
- Recipes registered by scanning can be deleted.

### Caution
- All scan filters are turned off by default.
- One item is consumed at the time of scanning.
- All energy filters are turned off by default.
- Since conversion loss occurs, even if you return to the same material after energy conversion, it will not be the same number.
- Those with materials such as iron are somewhat required for materials at the time of material conversion.
- I think balance is not good.
