### Usage
- Research on material energy.
- install a material converter
- Select Energize material from the Processing tab and enable the filter for items to be energized.
- Since energy is generated when it is processed, it will save energy properly.
- Items that are energized from substances can now be converted from energy to material, so again select materialization from the processing tab of the material converter.
- Energy is used and materialized.

### Function
- Energy conversion from substances is possible in units of 10 and 100.
- Material conversion from energy is possible in units of 1, 10 units.

### Caution
- All energy filters are turned off by default.
- Since conversion loss occurs, even if you return to the same material after energy conversion, it will not be the same number.
- Those with materials such as iron are somewhat required for materials at the time of material conversion.
- I think balance is not good.
